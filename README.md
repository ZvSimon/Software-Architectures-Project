# Ordering Sharing System Management

The project consists of designing and implementing an online order management system, where a
customer (end user) can choose, order, and pay for his selection from a catalog of products.
Letâ€™s take the example of a group of friends going out for a Bowling gathering. Every person can
select drinks, snacks, or desserts using his/her own smartphone, and at the end, one person can pay
for all, or each person can pay his/her own order, or part of the order.
